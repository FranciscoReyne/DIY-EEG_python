### Notes:

*this is my experimental eeg monitor

the headband has three electrodes

which are connected to a modified

ad8232 heart monitor

which is connected to my arduino

the tft display is showing

4 if possible 32 traces

if i touch any of the electrodes you'll

see the

traces move

when the headband is worn any electrical

activity is displayed

on the traces

thank you for watching*
